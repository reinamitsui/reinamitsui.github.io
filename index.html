            <p>I'm from JapanðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. This is my third semester. It still hard for me to 
               learn a lot of things in English. However I'm trying hard to improve myself. 
               If I have something I don't understand I always ask someone. </P>
            <p>I like playing golf. I started to play golf two years ago which is not quite long.
               However, my golf skill is improving. So I hit farther than the average woman. 
               I'd love you to build golf range in BYUH to keep practice. </p>
